# ADK TS Demo

This is a demonstration of the ADK TypeScript library. It's an agent system that is designed to help you remodel your home. It consists of four agents:

The first is the root agent, a project coordinator. It handles communication and delegates all the work to other agents.

The second (the first subagent) is a design consultant that will help take your idea from a concept to a more specific set of changes.
Third is a material sourcer that finds the items across multiple vendors' inventory and price matches to get the best price.
Fourth is a contractor scout that searches for contractors to do the work and drafts an email to send.
